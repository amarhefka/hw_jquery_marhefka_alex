## Resources
I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
I added this README file after I merged the jQuery branch into the master branch, so it's only complete on the master branch. I hope that's OK!
